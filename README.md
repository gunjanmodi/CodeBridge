# CodeBridge
## Learn new programming languages by comparing them to the ones you already know.


The CodeBridge application features a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to select the programming concepts they want to compare across two different languages. For example, if you're familiar with arrays in Python and want to learn how to use arrays in Java, you can select "arrays" from the list of concepts and compare the syntax and usage in both languages side by side.


## Features

- Compare programming concepts and syntax
- Explanations and examples of each concept
- Tips and best practices
- Community forum
